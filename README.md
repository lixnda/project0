## Project Description

Our project is a minimialistic system essential to developing a web blog. Users can create an account, log in, and freely create or edit their own blogs using our amazing
built-in editor with a plethora of features such as text styling and version rollback. Anyone can access blogs without an account, but only logged-in users can follow other users, upvote/downvote their blogs, 
and comment on other user's blogs. On the home page, users should be able to search for blogs with titles or specific tags, filter blogs by most upvotes,
and filter blogs made by their followers. Users can also view others' posted blogs by going to their profile. All of the database storage will be done using sqlite.
